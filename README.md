HACK FOR NF AND HELP END NF &amp; OTHER RARE DISEASES FOR PATIENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD

https://nfhack-platform.bemyapp.com/#/event

DESCRIPTION
Rare diseases affect nearly 350 million people around the world, and NF specifically affects 1 in 3,000 across the globe each year. During the Hack for NF, we want you to utilize the datasets provided to improve data analytics, research methodology, and advance the field of NF (neurofibromatosis) & rare diseases.
 
Your solutions can range from new ways to analyze data and identify new drugs and targets, to engaging patients via mobile devices, to data visualization apps & analytical tools for the NF portal.

The data for all participants to use for the hackathon is now available! You may access the data through the Synapse website here, and please visit the "Resources" section of the platform for more information.
